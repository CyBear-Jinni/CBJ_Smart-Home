  A CyBear Jinni snap for smart devices.

  Using this snap you can make your device smart and control lamp or blind (if the device is supported currently only NanoPi Duo2), you will be able to control it using physical buttons and even from your phones using CyBear Jinni app.

  Our goal here at CyBear Jinni is to raise the quality of life for everyone.
  We are doing this by making Smart-Home accessible for the common person.

  This is open source project so feel free to take a look at the code and join us advancing the world forward.
